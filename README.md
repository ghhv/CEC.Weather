# CEC.Weather

This is the repository for the CEC.Weather Application.  It's a spinoff/manual fork of [CEC.Blazor](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/CEC.Blazor) demonstrating how to add new record types and their UI Components and Data Services.

Refer back to the main repository for details.

Please note that the repository is a "work in progress" for a set of articles on codeproject and an ebook.  As such it will change as I refactor and improve the code.
